# Description

This code is adapted from https://github.com/YRussac/LB-SDA.
When testing on different distributions, you only need to run "test_Bernoulli.py" or "test_smoothly.py".

Before running above files, first modify the file "param.py" for T (time horizon), K (number of arms), m (length of stationary phase, breakpoints=T/m), N (repeat times).
